## Word Bait

This is the initial attempt with Node for the Rentatize application. Need to ensure that you have Postgres installed. Create a database, with a user whose credentials you have access to. Use `example.env` as a template to create your `.env` file. Place your credentials in there, this will facilitate your apps ability to access the database.

To start, do an `npm install`, followed by an `npm build` to ensure you have the latest node modules. Then do `node server.js`

#### Gulp

It is recommended to setup gulp to assist with the build/test of the UI. Here are the steps to get Gulp setup on your device:

1. `npm install gulp -g` - Installing the command to be used globally
2. `gulp watch` - Instantiating gulp watching of files (recommended to have your server started first)
3. Add the [liveReload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei/related?hl=en) extension to chrome
4. Access http://localhost:3000 & start making changes and see them happen without reload!

### Migrations

Look here to checkout the table descriptions in JavaScript.

Here is our [Database Schema](http://code.rentatize.com/core/main/wikis/database-design).

If you want to create your own migration, please refer to the documentation here: http://knexjs.org/#Migrations

### Models

Look here to checkout the model relationships

### Routes

Routes are referenced and added to the server.js. Most information regarding
routes are defined in the route folder.

### Public

Public is used to display the statically available content using expressjs. The public folder consists of code that is auto-generated using gulp. This can be set up to automatically update on change, as to avoid running `gulp build` or `npm build` way to often.

Ensure that you have gulp installed `sudo npm install gulp -g` then just run `gulp` in the base directory. As you make changes to the files in /app they will be merged into the code in /public.
